You should use your company's Office 365 tenant to create the production IVR.  This is a preferred method. 

However, during proof of concept/exploration phase, you may choose to start in a temporary test account, using a free trial in Office 365.  Below are the steps to create a free temporary trial.  If you are happy with your IVR, you can then convert this account to a paid account.

NOTE: If you are a part of Private Preview program, feel free to reach out to your Microsoft Bot Framework contact to request a trial to be extended to the needed development and testing timeline.

First, start by opening a new InPrivate window in your browser to avoid being signed in to existing Microsoft services. Go to https://aka.ms/ivr1:

In the window that opens, you need to select the "E5" plan (right-most column). Under the "Buy now" button, click on **Try for free**.

You need to register for the trial. Provide your e-mail address where you want to receive the confirmation, and click **Next**:

If you use an e-mail address that does not already have an account, you can click **Create new account**:

Verify you are not a robot by getting a text message or a call.  Press **Send verification code**:

Next, this is where you will create your Tenant. All user logins you will use in this tenant will end up looking like user@TENANT.onmicrosoft.com in this trial.  You will be able to use a custom domain later.  Press **Check availability**:
