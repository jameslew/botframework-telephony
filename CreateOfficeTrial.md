You should use your company's Office 365 tenant to create the production IVR.  This is a preferred method. 

However, during proof of concept/exploration phase, you may choose to start in a temporary test account, using a free trial in Office 365.  Below are the steps to create a free temporary trial.  If you are happy with your IVR, you can then convert this account to a paid account.

NOTE: If you are a part of Private Preview program, feel free to reach out to your Microsoft Bot Framework contact to request a trial to be extended to the needed development and testing timeline.

First, start by opening a new InPrivate window in your browser to avoid being signed in to existing Microsoft services. Go to https://aka.ms/ivr1:
