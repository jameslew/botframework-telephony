# Create a Bot

In this step, we will create a new bot in Azure that we could then link to a phone number. There are two ways to create a bot using Microsoft Bot Framework: using Azure Bot Service or Bot Framework Composer.

## Create a bot using Azure Bot Service

Creating a bot using Azure Bot Service is recommended for users who need to quickly create and deploy a bot in Azure and prefer a code-first approach (as opposed to a low-code approach of Bot Framework Composer, as described below)

Create a bot by clicking [here](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BotServiceSdkGalleryPackage). Additional instructions on how to create and configure the bot as well as download the source code are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/abs-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Create a bot using Bot Framework Composer

Create a bot using Bot Framework Composer is recommended for users who need to design complex dialogs using a visual interface.
