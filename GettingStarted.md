# Getting started

Are you ready to build a bot that answers phone calls? Follow these four easy steps:

* [Step 1: Create a new bot](CreateBot.md). You can skip this step if you already have a working bot.
* [Step 2: Get an Azure Communication Services Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource) and [acquire a phone number in it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony-sms/get-phone-number).

* [Step 3: Create a speech resource](CreateSpeechResource.md). You need an instance of the Speech Service to convert speech to text (for messages _received_ by the bot) and text to speech (for messages _sent_ by the bot)
* [Step 4: Configure the Telephony channel](EnableTelephony.md). This step connects it all together.

Once setup, you should be able to dial the acquired phone number using any phone and hear your bot echo your voice. If you hear that, congratulations! You're ready for dive deeper for more advanced features.
